    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "A chatbot is smart code that is capable of communicating similar to a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot models based on how they are built:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval based. A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response. It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative based models are not based on some predefined responses. They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation. In machine translation, we translate the source code from one language to another language but here, we are going to transform input into an output. It needs a large amount of data and it is based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques following the retrieval-based concept. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains conversation categories (intents), patterns, and responses. The model uses a Deep Neural Network with a single hidden layer to classify which category the input message belongs to and then the chatbot will select a random response from the list of responses, which have similar meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be used on websites pertaining to hospital, pharmaceutical online stores etc. or modified to fit completely different purposes. Furthermore, this is just a prototype whose functionality can be greatly expanded in topics it can reply to, depth of conversation, answer variety of questions and so on.\n",
